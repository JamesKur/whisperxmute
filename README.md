This is a more advanced version of Mute-Words. It uses WhisperX to obtain word-level timestamps of videos. It obtains the center channel of video files and transcribes them with word-level  timestamps.
The word-level timestamps are then used to mute videos in Kodi using edl files at a more accurate time, so that censors are more precise.
